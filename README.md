Slack Group
=============
Join the SLLOBS slack group [here](https://join.slack.com/t/saltlakelearn-7qx8407/shared_invite/enQtNzAwMjA3NjIwNjg4LTFkMWQ2NTUzZWJlMDcyOTM3ZmEwNzllYTdiZDc1NTU1ZGI3MDc2NTA2MWRkZmY0MjYxODAyMGRiMjQxNmRjZTM): 

Overview
========
The goal of the ***Salt Lake Learners of Biostats (SLLOBS)*** is to convene folks at all levels that are interested in learning (and teaching) 
basic concepts in data analysis and statistics for biological research. We will meet bi-weekly on Monday mornings at 9AM for one hour. 

One or more people will work together to learn and present a topic each week. ***The goal of each lecture is to***:

    - Give an accessible introduction to the topic
    - Provide clear examples and explanations
    - Demonstrate R code that conveys the topic 

This will indeed require effort by the presenter, but the idea is that a large group of interested folks will 
provide a large pool of both teachers and learners. 

The vision is that if we all attend and put our best effort forward, we will all learn together and have a shared 
foundation for future learning and discussion.

Expectations
============
***To be successful, SLLOBS will need to***:

    - attend (most) every meeting
    - read any required material before each lecture
    - make a concerted effort to contribute and present material for the group.

If members follow these expectations, we will have a large corpus of teaching and learning material that will be 
available to refer back to. Furthermore, ***it will be the basis for a formal course in the future***.

Grab bag of things to discuss in the future
========
- survival curves
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Gibbs sampling
- MCMC
- Power statistics
- MA plots:
